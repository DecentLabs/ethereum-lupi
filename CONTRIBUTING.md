## Contributing to Million Ether Game

React Starter Kit is currently the most widely adopted Node.js/React boilerplate used by many
tech startups around the globe. We're working hard to keep it up to date, making sure that it
follows best practices and high coding standards, paying extremely close attention to details.

Your contributions are welcome and are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit
will always be given.

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and
effective for everyone involved.

### Bugs & Feature Requests

Before opening an issue, please:


### Pull Requests

Before you submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) from your
forked repo, check that it meets these guidelines:

* If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated as part of the same PR.
* Create a separate PR for each small feature or bug fix.
* [Squash](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5189560/squash-my-last-x-commits-together-using-git)
  your commits into one for each PR.
* Run `npm test` to make sure that your code style is OK and there are no any regression bugs.

#### Style Guide

Our linter will catch most styling issues that may exist in your code. You can check the status
of your code styling by simply running: `npm run lint`

However, there are still some styles that the linter cannot pick up. If you are unsure about
something, looking at [Airbnb's Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) will guide you
in the right direction.
